# maclabhelper
This is a collection of scripts for helping me manage my school's creative lab with 30-plus Apple computers. Currently the scripts are written to be very specific to the configurations I work with, but I hope including them here can provide examples of Macintosh tricks to streamline maintenance. I also plan to post as many of the sources I used as I can.

This is a README-in-progress! I plan to update it more as I find the time.
